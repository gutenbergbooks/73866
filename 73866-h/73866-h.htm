</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was a sharp, frosty night late in
December, the wind driving the snow
in unfriendly gusts into the faces of the
passers-by, and compelling all who were
not actually obliged to encounter its violence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to seek as speedily as possible the shelter
of their own homes.</p>

<p>At the corner of a street leading out of
one of the many crowded thoroughfares in
the heart of the city, stood an old-fashioned
crockery shop, from the inner parlour of
which the cheerful glow of a coke fire,
reflected on the window-panes, made the
darkness without only seem more dreary
and desolate. Unmindful of wind and
snow, two little faces might have been seen
closely pressed against the window, eagerly
gazing on a sight which greeted their eyes
through the glass door separating the shop
from the room behind. The muslin blind,
which usually hung before it to screen those
within from the gaze of the outer world,
had accidentally dropped, and left to view
a cheerful group, consisting of father,
mother, and several children, seated at
their evening meal.</p>

<p>The kettle singing on the fire, the cat
comfortably lying on the snug hearth, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
clean white cloth, with the neat cups and
saucers, the home-made cake, and bread-and-butter,
above all, the happy faces of
the children, did not escape the eager notice
of the poor little wanderers, whose own
sad experience of life might have been
summed up in the few short but expressive
words—hungry and cold, motherless and
homeless.</p>

<p>It was the old story, alas, only too
common, of sin, suffering, and sorrow; the
drunkard husband going away, and leaving
the poor, worn-out, sorrow and care-stricken
wife to die in a miserable garret, and the
friendless little ones turned out alone on
the world, which seemed to them so large
and dreary. Sleeping now on a doorstep,
now under one of the numerous railway
arches, too often the only refuge of the
homeless and destitute, in the daytime
begging a few halfpence, or some scant
crusts, growing every day more dirty and
more forlorn; no wonder that the sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
a home which seemed to them (unaccustomed
to aught but want and woe) rich
in all that could be desired, should arrest
their eyes and make them gaze on wistfully,
forgetful of wind and cold.</p>

<p>No such home had ever been for them;
their earliest remembrances were of a dark,
damp cellar, a cruel father, and a sorrowful
and ailing mother; their latest of an old
tumble-down garret, where that mother lay
dying, without proper nourishment or kind,
loving care—no voice to whisper to her of
a Saviour’s love, or to bear to her heart
the glad tidings which could have shed a
light over the dark valley. Mingled with
these came the remembrances of the coarse
tones of the rough woman, who, as soon as
their mother was buried, had pushed them
into the street, telling them to “be gone,
and never to darken her doorway again,
the good-for-nothing brats.”</p>

<p>After gazing intently for some time at
the happy scene before them, the elder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of the two children, by a sudden, irresistible
impulse, at length darted up the steps, and
softly turning the handle of the door, crept
inside the shop, the younger one clinging
to her sister’s arm. Crouching down in a
corner, where they hoped to escape observation,
but with eyes and ears both on
the alert, they bent forward to catch the
sound of what was passing in the inner
room. For a moment all seemed to be
quiet, and then the father’s voice was heard
reading aloud. They saw the children
seated round the table, the elder ones
reading in turn, while the younger sat by,
quietly listening. They could even distinguish
some of the words, but, alas, they
were no familiar tones which fell on the
ears of the little beggar children; they
heard something about a Father pitying
His children, and, as the words were read,
instinctively the younger child whispered,
“That’s not our father. Whose father can
that be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Hush!” softly said the elder one, “or
they will hear us, and then we shall be
turned out.”</p>

<p>At that moment the outer door opened,
and another customer coming in, Mr.
Morley, the owner of the shop, stepped
out from behind the glass door. It was
only a message respecting some order
which had been given earlier in the day;
and no light being required, the trembling
children remained in security in their
hiding-place. At length, overcome by
fatigue, cold, and hunger, they fell asleep
in one another’s arms, the younger child
whispering, as she kissed her sister, “I
wish, Polly, we might stay here every
night, instead of sleeping out in the cold.”</p>

<p>Poor little ones! Uncared for on earth,
and deserted by the father who should
have watched over them with tender care
and love, but not uncared for up in heaven,
where even the little birds do not escape
notice. All unseen by them, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
bending down over those sleeping children
an Eye which never slumbers nor sleeps;
and even now, when they thought themselves
friendless in the wide world, their
Father in heaven did not forget them, but
was guiding their feet into the way of peace,
and disposing the hearts of His servants
to receive in His name and for His sake
these forlorn and weary outcasts, the little
ones for whom Jesus died, and whom He
is ever ready to “receive favourably and
to embrace with the arms of His mercy.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Mr. Morley was putting up his
shutters that night, and seeing that all was
safe in the shop, he caught his foot, and
stumbled over some plates which had been
piled on the floor; and on bringing a candle
to discover what mischief had been caused,
he caught sight of what seemed to him a
bundle of rags heaped together under a
shelf. Great was the good man’s astonishment,
on a closer inspection, to discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
beneath the rags the forms of the sleeping
children. Hastily calling his wife, and
carefully shading the light with his hand,
he stooped down and examined their faces.
Traces of tears could easily be seen on the
cheeks of the elder, who appeared to be
about eleven years of age, and the most
hasty glance at either could not have failed
to discover many unmistakeable signs of
want, hunger, and poverty.</p>

<p>Touched with tender pity for the forlorn
little ones, Mr. and Mrs. Morley consulted
together as to what they should do for
them. “Surely the Lord Himself has
brought them within the shelter of our
roof; and it’s a mercy to think they reached
it in safety, for with the wind and snow
driving as they are, there’s no telling
whether the poor little creatures would
have lived to see the light of another day.”
Then, hurrying upstairs, the kind-hearted
woman speedily returned with a warm
blanket from her own bed, and wrapped it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
carefully round the little sleepers, discoursing
to herself the while.</p>

<p>“Certainly they might have slept in the
attic, up at the top; but then there’s the
fear lest they might have felt frightened
like at finding themselves in a strange bed,
or at being woke of a sudden—no, John’s
right; John always knows best. Well,
thank the Lord for keeping the poor babes
from perishing on a night like this; and
thank Him too for giving us, just now,
when our hearts are sorely yearning after
our own little one in the heavenly fold,
something to do for His lambs still in a
world of sin and sorrow.”</p>

<p>A tear stood in the good woman’s eye
as she spoke. Only a few months back
she had known what it was to part with
the little child that had twined itself round
her mother’s heart in no ordinary way—loving
little Lily; so sweet and gentle,
with such endearing ways, and taken after
an illness of only a few days, leaving a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
sore blank behind. The tender mother’s
heart seemed to open at once to the little
friendless ones whom God had led to her
door; and she lay awake long that night,
planning how to do the best for them,
should it prove, as she felt in her own
mind persuaded, that they were homeless
and destitute.</p>

<p>Surely that night, over the homely
dwelling, a heavenly smile was resting,
even the blessing of Him who has said in
His own holy Book: “Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these My brethren, ye
have done it unto Me.”</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i017.jpg" alt="W">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>ITH her mind full of concern and kind
thoughts for the poor little strangers,
Mrs. Morley rose early the next morning,
and hastily dressing, went down before
rousing her own children, to see whether
they were still sleeping. To her great
astonishment, on opening the door of the
shop, and unfastening the shutters, they
were nowhere to be found. In the corner
lay the blanket she had so carefully
wrapped round them the night before, but
no trace of the children could be seen.
On examining the bolt of the front door,
she saw that it had been slipped back, and
that they must evidently have gone out
before it was light, probably fearing to
encounter the cross words, or even blows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
which had hitherto repulsed them from
door after door where they had sought
shelter.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Morley blamed herself greatly
for not having carried them upstairs to the
attic; and both she and her husband were
sorely grieved to think of the poor children
wandering perhaps without food, shelter, or
friend. “We’ll leave the door unlatched
again to-night, and maybe they’ll come
back to the place where they once found
shelter and warmth. Poor things! it’s a
wonder they didn’t take the blanket, with
only those few thin rags scarcely covering
them. I had been looking out some of
our Lily’s things for them: it cost me
something to go to that drawer this
morning, and take them out one by one;
but a verse came into my mind, which
helped me to give them up: ‘Neither will
I offer unto the Lord my God of that
which doth cost me nothing;’ and then it
seemed quite easy to take my darling’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
things and give them to Him who has
said, ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these, ye have done it
unto Me.’ And so now, whether these
little ones come again to us or not, my
mind is made up, and Lily’s things shall
be given to some of the needy ones whom
the Good Shepherd is going out to seek
in the wilderness, and bring back to His
heavenly fold.”</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, Mr. Morley
called his children; and after reading a
chapter with them as usual, and asking for
a heavenly blessing on each, before they
set off for school or work, he told them of
the little wanderers who had found a
shelter under their roof the night before,
and asked them to pray each night and
morning that God their Father would
fetch home these poor children to His
blessed fold on earth, and give them a
place in His heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>The children all listened with much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
interest to their father’s account. Susie,
the eldest girl, was a pupil-teacher in the
school where her younger sister and brother
went, and on Sunday afternoons took a
class in a ragged school not far distant;
and she had learned to feel a tender love
for the poor little ones for whom the Lord
Jesus died, but who, until they came to the
school, had heard but little of a Saviour’s
love.</p>

<p>Elsie, the second girl, had left school,
and helped her mother at home and in the
shop; Alice and Johnny went every day
to school under Susie’s care; and Daisy,
the third girl, was an invalid. Crippled in
body by a fall when quite young, but not
in mind nor heart nor understanding, Daisy,
whose weak and feeble frame had long
since ceased to grow, grew in grace and
heavenly wisdom year by year. In her
quiet corner by the fireside, or oftener
lying on the little couch, to which she was
sometimes kept for weeks together, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
sweet and peaceful face was a constant
lesson to the busy ones around her, and
all who knew her, old and young, would
tell how the heavenly-minded child had
often helped and cheered them on their
way. Daisy would knit socks and comforters
for Susie’s ragged children; and
though she could not go out to teach them
of the loving Saviour, as her sister did, she
could speak to Him for them, and many a
silent prayer went up for them from Daisy’s
heart into the ears of Him who so tenderly
listens to the voices of little children:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“For He loves His little children,</div>
<div class="verse">And He pleadeth for them there,</div>
<div class="verse">Asking the great God of heaven</div>
<div class="verse">That their sins may be forgiven;</div>
<div class="indent">And He hears the prayer.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>When Susan came home from her class
on Sunday afternoons, Daisy was always
full of eager questions about the children,
and would lie with her large eyes fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
on her sister, as she told of the poor little
ones whom she was trying to teach about
Jesus.</p>

<p>Susie had gentle ways, and loved her
little sister dearly, and devoted much of
her spare time to her; while Daisy in
return unconsciously taught her elder
sister many a lesson of patient submission
and quiet trust. For never can the life of
anyone, however young, feeble, and apparently
helpless, that is really united to
Jesus Christ by living faith, be spent in
vain. “The fruit of the righteous is a
tree of life;” and whether that fruit be
manifested in active service or in patient
suffering, it shall not be in vain in the
Lord. After all, it is not so much our
work as our will that God asks and desires
of us—the offering up of ourselves as a
reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice; and
the little child that day by day looks up
to heaven, and tries from love to Jesus
to be gentle, loving, and obedient, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
bear with quiet patience the weary pain
which keeps it still and lonely when other
children are at their merry pastimes, does
not live in vain, but is bringing forth the
fruit of righteousness, to the praise and
glory of God.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Weeks and months went by; but no
more was seen or heard of the little
strangers, though night after night the
Morleys’ door was left unlatched, in the
hope of their return; and every day when
the children gathered round the hearth the
father ended his petitions with an earnest
prayer that the little lost ones might one
day be found, either on earth or in heaven.</p>

<p>Daisy’s confidence that God would hear,
and that some day they would be brought
back, was unshaken, though day after day
passed by without bringing anything further
to light about them. “Our prayer-children,”
she would call them; and perhaps few little
beggar children ever had so many loving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
thoughts bestowed on them, so many sweet
prayers breathed upwards into the ears of
the Lord of heaven and earth, prayers that
were not spoken in vain, but which were
even now preparing a harvest of blessing.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i025.jpg" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was a bright Sunday in July, and the
bells of some of the neighbouring
churches were ringing for afternoon service,
as Susan Morley, after leaving her little
brother and sister at the door of their school,
made her way through some narrow bye-streets
to the little ragged school that was
so dear to her heart, and from which on
Sunday afternoons for the last four years
nothing had ever kept her absent.</p>

<p>It was a rough-looking place, which had
formerly been used as a coal-shed; but
loving hands had hung the walls with sweet
texts and pictures, and transformed it into
a pleasant-looking place within; while the
humble appearance of its exterior had this
advantage, that it attracted, while a grander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
building would have frightened away, the
very class of children it was so desirable to
get hold of.</p>

<p>A stranger going in that afternoon, as
he looked round on the clean faces of the
children, and marked their generally tidy
appearance, and quiet orderly behaviour,
might have questioned the fact of its being
a <i>ragged</i> school. Very different was the
appearance of the children who attended
it ten years previously, when it was first
opened through the loving thoughts and
efforts of some kind friends who had
laboured earnestly in behalf of the lost
little ones; and very different was the
neighbourhood generally then, from what
it now was. Through those years of
patient toil and prayer the earnest workers
had seen, at first perhaps only dimly, here
and there tokens for good to bid them not
be weary in well-doing; but now, in looking
back, they could feel how the good
hand of their God had indeed been upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
them, and multiplied the seed sown a
hundredfold. To homes once sunk in
darkness and ignorance had the blessed
light been carried, and little children,
taught of Jesus, had borne home to their
parents the glad tidings of great joy, and
taught the lips which first taught them to
speak the words of eternal life. Thus had
the wilderness been turned into a fruitful
field; and in the day of the harvest those
patient sowers shall doubtless come again
with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with
them.</p>

<p>As Susan opened the door of the school,
a group of children followed her in; and
on taking her place in the class, a little girl
stepped forward, and curtseying, said:
“Please, teacher, you told us last Sunday
that we were to try and say ‘come’ to
somebody else, and on the way here I saw
two little girls standing at the corner of our
street, and I asked them if they wouldn’t
like to come to school with me, and hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
what teacher would tell us about Jesus, and
they said they’d like to come, only they’d
got such ragged things, they didn’t like
to come in, because, perhaps, the ladies
would be angry, and send them away; but
I said you didn’t mind how ragged we
were, if only we came. But when they
got near the school they looked frightened,
and said they couldn’t come, unless so be
I asked leave for them. Oh! can I fetch
them in, teacher? I said I was sure you’d
say ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>The eager request was soon granted;
and before many minutes the child returned,
leading, one on either side of her, the poor
children for whom she had pleaded. They
were indeed ragged, and the sad, pinched
look on both faces told of the privations
they must have suffered. Susan spoke to
them very kindly, and, gradually reassured
by her gentle voice and manner, they
gained confidence, and ventured to look
round them. When prayers were over, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the other children had said their texts and
hymns, Susan turned to the little strangers
and asked them a few simple questions;
amongst others, whether they had ever
heard of heaven? The elder of the two
looked at her thoughtfully for a moment,
and then said, “Isn’t that the place where
nobody wants nothing to eat or drink?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i029.jpg" alt="Teacher and students"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Deeply touched by an answer which
told so much, in a few short words, of the
suffering and want with which they were
evidently so early familiarised, but unwilling
to show what she felt, Susan answered:
“Quite right, dear; heaven is a place
where nobody wants for anything; every
one there is quite happy. But can you tell
me how we may get there?”</p>

<p>No responsive word or look came this
time from either of the little new-comers;
but amongst Susan’s own children many
a hand was held out, and when she made
a sign to one of them to answer, a little
girl named Jane Hardy said, “Please,
teacher, for Jesus Christ’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, dear; but now tell me
what you mean when you say, ‘for Jesus
Christ’s sake.’”</p>

<p>“Please, teacher, because Jesus came
down from heaven to die for our sins; and
if our sins are forgiven for His sake, and
our naughty hearts changed by His Holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Spirit, we shall go to heaven when we
die.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, dear; it is only because of
our Saviour Christ’s great love in leaving
His home above, and coming down to our
earth to live and die for us, that we can
have any sure and certain hope of ever
reaching heaven. You know the little
verse which says—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘And this, not for any good thing we have done,</div>
<div class="verse">But all for the sake of His well-beloved Son.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>And now tell me if Jesus is willing to
receive little children into His beautiful
home.”</p>

<p>Several hands were held out, and almost
with one voice the children answered:
“Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
and forbid them not, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<p>Susan then told the children to turn to
their Bibles; and, after reading with them
the parable of the lost sheep, she told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
them as simply as possible, how Jesus is
the Good Shepherd who goes out after the
lost sheep, and never rests until He has
found them; how by the “lost sheep” are
meant those who have not known His love
in dying for them; how tenderly He loves
little children, and longs for them to come
into His fold. She explained to them how
weak and unable to protect themselves
the sheep are; and just so, how feeble and
helpless we all are in ourselves, and what
need we have to be led and kept day by
day in the right way. She spoke to them
of the tender love of the Good Shepherd
for every one, even the least and feeblest of
His lambs; of their great enemy, the devil,
from whom He died to deliver them: how
He knows each little one by name, keeps
His eye always upon them, watches over
them by night and by day, goes after them
when they wander from Him, and brings
them back to His fold; and, at length,
when life is over, receives them into His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
own gloriously bright and holy kingdom
above.</p>

<p>The children all listened quietly and
attentively; and amongst the little eyes
fixed on the kind young teacher, none
seemed more riveted than the poor little
stranger-children, by whom alone of all
the class the sweet story of old—the story
which is ever new—was heard for the
first time.</p>

<p>When school was over, the children
stood up and sang together the sweet
hymn, which followed so well on the subject
of the lesson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Jesus is our Shepherd,</div>
<div class="indent">Wiping every tear,</div>
<div class="verse">Folded in His bosom,</div>
<div class="indent">What have we to fear?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the class was dismissed, Susan
called the little strangers to her, and asked
them their names, and where they lived,
and if they would like to come to the
school again. The elder one answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“I’m called Polly, and that’s Lizzie. We
don’t live nowhere. This is a rare nice
place; we’d like to come again.”</p>

<p>“And have you no father or mother?”</p>

<p>“Please, ’m, mother’s dead, and father
went away to sea long ago, and we’ve
nobody to look after us.”</p>

<p>“And where are you going now?”</p>

<p>“We shall walk about till it’s dark, and
then creep under one of the arches, or on
to a doorstep, if nobody don’t turn us
away; but most often we get turned away
from one house after another, or the police
sees us, and then we has to hide away as
fast as we can. It’s not as bad now as in
the winter. Lizzie gets a cough then; and
I don’t know how to keep her warm; we
often shiver all night long. Arches is
draughty; but sometimes we find an old
barrel, and creep into that; that’s the best
place.”</p>

<p>“Not quite the best,” said the younger
child; “we once slept in a warm place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The elder child here shook her head at
poor little Lizzie, and made a sign to her
to say no more; but the movement did not
escape Susan’s observation, and only served
to confirm what she had already strongly
suspected, that these poor, forlorn children
were none other than Daisy’s “prayer-children.”
It had been her earnest hope
that somehow, through means of the
ragged school, which brought her into
contact with so many of the poor children
and homes of the neighbourhood, she might
learn something about them; and now the
longings and prayers of the past months
seemed at length about to be answered.
Their eyes brightened when Susan asked
them if they would like to go home with
her, and to have some warm tea and bread-and-butter;
and poor little Lizzie could
not resist saying, “We’re so hungry;
we’ve had nothing but some dry crusts
since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>Telling them to keep close to her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
talking to them, as they walked along, of
the Good Shepherd who loved them, and
was even now seeking to bring them to
His fold, Susan led them to her own home.
The shutters being closed, the children did
not at first recognize the place where six
months before they had found shelter; but
as Susan led them through the shop, watching
their faces meanwhile, to discover any
sign of recognition, Lizzie suddenly pulled
her sister’s arm, and said in a low voice,
“Wasn’t this the place where we slept
that night?”</p>

<p>Polly looked frightened, and whispered,
“Perhaps we shall be punished for it;”
and in another moment both of them would
have darted out of the door, had not Susan
closed it and taken them by the hand,
saying to them very gently, “Don’t be
afraid, dear children; this is the nice place
where you once slept, one cold night in
the winter, and we hoped you would have
come to it again, and used to leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
door unlatched for you every night. God
your Father in heaven led you here, and
we asked Him to bring you back, and He
has heard our prayers. Polly and Lizzie
needn’t fear anything now; for, if they
are good, they shall stay here always, and
never sleep out in the cold any more
again.”</p>

<p>Then leading them into the inner room,
she brought them to Daisy, who was lying
on her couch in the window, and said:</p>

<p>“Daisy, here are your ‘prayer-children,’
found at last through your prayers and my
dear little school.”</p>

<p>Daisy’s face beamed with joy and thankfulness.
During the quiet hour while her
brother and sisters were at school, and her
father and mother at church, she had been
praying that Jesus would suffer these little
children to come unto Him, and that they
might be found; and even while the prayer
was rising up from her heart the answer of
peace was coming down, and the promise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of old being fulfilled: “It shall come to
pass, that before they call, I will answer;
and while they are yet speaking, I will
hear.”</p>

<p>There was general rejoicing that afternoon
in the Morleys’ home when the rest
of the family came in.</p>

<p>Kind Mrs. Morley, with Elsie’s help,
soon washed and dressed the poor children
in some better garments than their own
miserable rags; and the loving mother’s
heart did not repent when she saw poor
little Lizzie sitting at the tea-table that
evening in Lily’s place, and clad in Lily’s
clothes.</p>

<p>Happy, thrice happy, they who know
the joy and blessed privilege of ministering
to the Lord of glory, in the person even
of a little child, and who, from love to the
Saviour who loved them and gave Himself
for them, receive one such little one
in His name.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="antiqua">“Jesus called a little child unto Him.”</span></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i039.jpg" alt="W">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN school hours were over on week
days, Susan Morley used often to
visit the homes of her Sunday scholars;
and one afternoon, about a year after the
events recorded in the last chapter, she set
out for this purpose, with the wish too of
seeing one who had been absent from the
class the day before. It was another poor
child who had been brought into the
school by the same little Jane, whose
earnest efforts to say “Come” to others
had led to the rescuing of Daisy’s “prayer-children.”</p>

<p>For some time the child had come
regularly to the class; but when Jane
called for her as usual one Sunday afternoon,
she found her in tears, and on inquiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the cause, the child told her that
her mother had said she should never go
to the school again. Jane had tried to
comfort her, by promising to ask her teacher
to come and see her, and did not fail to
lay the case before Susan as soon as school
was over. Susan had already made some
inquiries respecting the child’s home, and
was much afraid, from what she had heard,
that it would not be an easy matter to
persuade the mother to send her. However,
seeking help and guidance where none
ever seek in vain, she set out the following
afternoon to see what could be done, and
to try if possible to soften the hard heart
of poor little Bessie’s stepmother, and
induce her to retract her threat.</p>

<p>Turning down some narrow streets, she
made her way into the close, dingy-looking
alley, in a court of which was Bessie’s
home. Groups of dirty children were
playing about in the gutters; and women
with untidy hair, lounging at their doors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
stared at her as she passed; but, quietly
looking upwards, she made her way through
the midst of them without annoyance, and
at last reached the door of the miserable
house, in a garret of which little Jane had
told her Bessie would be found.</p>

<p>The staircase was narrow and steep,
with scant glimmer of light; and the sound
of rude voices in some of the rooms, as
she made her way with difficulty up the
broken stairs, did not tend to reassure her.
At last she reached the top; but, to her
surprise, whilst pausing for a moment before
knocking at the door, she heard a little
voice inside singing. It was the old
familiar hymn, sung almost every Sunday
at the school, “There is a happy land, far,
far away;” and the little singer seemed so
to enjoy the words, and to sing them with
such heart, that Susan did not like to
interrupt her, but waited till she had
finished before knocking at the door for
admittance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>When she did so, no one said, “Come
in;” and she was obliged to repeat her
knock, this time saying as she did so,
“Bessie, dear, are you at home? I’ve
come to see you.”</p>

<p>The door was not opened, but a voice
from within answered, “Oh, please, teacher,
I’m so sorry I can’t open the door; but
mother’s locked me in, and taken the key,
for fear I should run out and leave the
babies. I’ve got to take care of them till
she comes home.”</p>

<p>“Very well, dear, never mind about the
door; but tell me why you did not come
yesterday to school. I was so sorry not
to have you in the class.”</p>

<p>The child did not answer at once, and
Susan almost reproached herself for having
asked the question, for she fancied she
heard the sound of a stifled sob, and then
the child said in broken tones:</p>

<p>“I like to come to the school, but I
mustn’t come again. Mother says she won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
have me go there, and she’ll beat me if I
do; but I want so to hear some more
about Jesus, and I’m trying to speak to
Him, as you told us.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, dear; and do you think
if I were to teach you a little prayer to say
to Him, you would say it every night and
morning, and whenever else you are able
through the day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, teacher, that I would.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, dear, I want you to say
after me: ‘O God, give me Thy Holy
Spirit, and take away all my sins, for Jesus
Christ’s sake.’”</p>

<p>The child repeated the words after Susan
several times, until she thought she could
remember them. Then Susan spoke to
her as well as she could through the closed
door about the loving Saviour, who died
for little children, and who would wash
away her sins, if she asked Him, in His
precious blood, and give His Holy Spirit
to teach and guide her in the right way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and at last, through His own great love,
bring her to the happy land she had been
singing about. Then taking a little card
with a text on it out of her pocket, she
slipped it under the door, and told Bessie
to try and learn it by the next time she
came, and promised if she knew it perfectly
she should have another.</p>

<p>Bessie read the words on it, “I love
them that love Me, and those that seek
Me early shall find Me;” and then Susan
said:</p>

<p>“Do you know who it is that says this,
dear Bessie?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t tell us, teacher; but I should
think it must be Jesus, because you said
He loves us.”</p>

<p>“And do you love Jesus, Bessie?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, teacher, I do love Him.”</p>

<p>“Why do you love Him, dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh, teacher, because He died to save
us from going to the dreadful place, and
because He’s so good to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“And do you know, dear, what the verse
means when it says, ‘Those that seek Me
<i>early</i> shall find Me’?”</p>

<p>“Early in the morning, teacher, before
we think of anything else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, we should think of Him as
soon as we wake in the morning; our first
thought should be of Him and His love;
but it means something beside this—that
while you are young, quite in the morning
of life, you should seek Him as your Saviour
and Friend, not wait till you are grown
up, because you may never live till then,
and the sweet promise is for children,
‘Those that seek Me <i>early</i> shall find Me.’
I hope little Bessie is beginning to seek
Jesus early.”</p>

<p>“Yes, teacher; and I hope I shall see
Him some day. I often lie awake at night;
and through the chinks in the roof I sometimes
see the stars, and they look so bright,
and I know Jesus made them, and I say
to myself, ‘Jesus’s home is brighter even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
than those stars; and maybe some day I
shall get there, if my sins are washed away,
and my naughty heart is made clean.’
And when the babies are cross, and my
arm aches with nursing them, I sing my
hymns and verses, and I forget I’m tired,
and I feel so happy; but I do want to
come to school again.”</p>

<p>Susan promised the child to see if she
could persuade her mother to give her
leave to return to the class; but bidding
her, whether or not, to try to be gentle,
obedient, and patient, and thus to show
her love to the Lord Jesus, who had loved
her with so great a love, she said good-bye
to her, and made her way once more down
the rickety staircase.</p>

<p>As she went down, she heard the little
voice upstairs beginning to sing again the
old favourite hymn; and with feelings of
deep thankfulness she thought to herself,
“Truly, of such is the kingdom of heaven;”
so simply had this little child received the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
message of Christ’s love into her heart,
and as a little palm-tree flourishing in the
midst of a desert land, because its roots
are watered by a hidden spring, was bringing
forth in an ungodly home, and with
every outward disadvantage, the fruit of
holiness, to the glory and praise of God.</p>

<p>Susan made many efforts to see little
Bessie’s stepmother, but without success.
She went out to work early in the morning,
and purposely avoided seeing her at other
times. When Susan called at the house,
little Bessie, if not out, was always locked
into the room. But the child had many
happy talks with her kind teacher through
the closed door; and though not allowed to
come back to the school, she learned, week
after week, the verses which Susan slipped
for her under the door, and was treasuring
up in her heart a store of precious texts
which no one could take away from her.
After some time Susan managed to send
her a Bible by little Jane, and the joy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the child at having one of her own was
unbounded.</p>

<p>“I can now read all about Jesus, and
perhaps some day mother will let me read
it to her.”</p>

<p>One evening, a few months later on, as
Susan was sitting after tea by Daisy’s
couch, reading to her, the shop-bell rang,
and on going to answer it Elsie found little
Jane waiting with a pale face, and tears in
her eyes. She had been running fast, and
was so out of breath she could not speak for
a minute, but at last managed to get out
that Susan was wanted directly. Bessie’s
mother had sent her—there had been an
accident, and Bessie was hurt, and had
been taken to the hospital, and was asking
for “teacher.”</p>

<p>Susan was ready in a moment, and before
long reached the hospital, little Jane going
with her as far as the entrance, and telling
her the few particulars she had gathered
from Bessie’s stepmother about what had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
happened. It appeared that the child had
been sent out early in the morning with
some violets to sell; but not finding as
many customers as usual, and fearing her
stepmother’s anger if she returned without
selling them, she had lingered about the
streets till dusk. Jane had met her, and
tried to persuade her to come home; but
she said, “Oh no! not till I have sold
my flowers; mother will be so vexed if I
don’t!”</p>

<p>When Jane asked her if she were not
very tired and hungry, she said she was
tired, and she had a pain in her side, but
she was saying over her verses and hymns,
and this helped her to forget how tired she
was.</p>

<p>As Jane left her she heard her saying to
herself, “He shall gather the lambs with
His arm, and carry them in His bosom”—the
last verse Susan had given her to learn.
She had not been at home much more than
an hour, when Bessie’s stepmother ran in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and told her to fetch Miss Morley at once—that
Bessie had been run over by a
waggon, and had been taken to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Susan hurried upstairs to the ward where
the poor child had been carried; the doctor
and nurse were standing on one side of the
bed as she entered, and, from the grave
look on the face of the former, she guessed
what was indeed the case, that little or
no hope was entertained of the child’s
recovery. Both her legs had been broken,
and her head severely injured as well. Her
stepmother was sitting at the foot of the
bed, and seemed half stupefied. Susan
stepped forward quietly, and bending
down over the poor little sufferer, said in a
gentle voice, “He shall gather the lambs
with His arm, and carry them in His
bosom.”</p>

<p>The little eyes, which had been closed
until now, opened for a moment with
returning consciousness, and the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
smiled as the familiar words fell on her
ear, and held out her hand to Susan.
Then, looking up with a bright smile, she
whispered, “I’m so happy. Tell mother
I’m going to Jesus; and I hope she’ll come
too.” She made an effort to say, “He
shall gather the lambs with His arm;” and
then with one little sigh, turning her head
on the pillow, as if going to sleep, she was
gently gathered into the fold of the Good
Shepherd above.</p>

<p>Dear little Bessie! No more rough
words or blows, no more pain and hunger,
no more tears, “the waves of this troublesome
world” safely crossed, and the little
ship at anchor in the fair haven, where
they who enter in “shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more; neither shall the
sun light on them, nor any heat. For the
Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
shall feed them, and shall lead them unto
living fountains of waters: and God shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes.”</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i052.jpg" alt="A">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>BOUT two years after little Bessie’s
death, Daisy, whose health had been
failing very much during the summer
months, was ordered to go away for some
time to a drier and milder place; and as
Mrs. Morley had a sister, the wife of a
farmer, living at a little village on the
south coast, it was arranged that she should
spend the winter with her.</p>

<p>Little Lizzie was to go too, partly as a
companion for Daisy, and also because she
was far from strong herself; for though in
better health than when she and her sister
were received into the Morleys’ home, she
had never thoroughly recovered from the
effects of early neglect and exposure to all
weathers. She and Polly had continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to go to the little school which had been
the means, through God’s blessing, of
rescuing them from their life of misery.
Their love and gratitude to the kind friends
who had taken them into their home had
from the first been most touching, and
amply repaid Mr. Morley and his wife for
the disinterested kindness and tender pity
with which they had received into their
home, and treated as their own children,
the friendless little ones, who had no other
claim upon them than their misery and
wretchedness.</p>

<p>There were many regrets in the Morleys’
home when the time came for Daisy and
Lizzie to set off on their long journey; for
all knew how sadly Daisy would be missed
from her accustomed corner, and little
Lizzie was a general favourite. Mr.
Morley went with them the greater part of
the way, and saw them safely into the
coach which was to carry them the last
twenty miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Daisy bore the journey better than
could have been expected; and both Lizzie
and she met with a kindly welcome from
the good old farmer and his wife, who had
no children of their own, and were well
pleased at the thought of having some
young faces about them. The old-fashioned
farmhouse, nestling down in a sheltered
nook, with the hills rising behind it, was
the picture of comfort and peace both
within and without.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, as they looked
out from the windows of the snug sitting-room,
the quiet beauty of the scene which
lay before them filled both the children
with wonder and delight. The farm stood
at the head of a valley well wooded with
fir-trees, and opening down on to the bay;
a little stream ran gurgling down its rocky
bed only a few yards from the garden gate,
while the cliff itself, down which a winding-path
led to the shore, was covered with
creepers and ivy, and rich in every kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
foliage. The trees were still in the beauty
of their autumn tints, and to Daisy, whose
eyes never saw a tree from one year’s end
to another, it seemed a perfect paradise.</p>

<p>But the crowning delight to both the
children was the wide sea, which bounded
the view, and which stretched away to
right and left, as far as eye could reach.
As they looked out on it for the first time
in their lives, it seemed to them more
wondrous and beautiful than anything they
had ever imagined. Here and there in
the far distance they could see the sails
of some ships bound for a far-off land, the
rising sun just tipping them with gold; or
nearer home, down in the bay below, the
little fishing-boats returning home after the
night’s toil. They were never tired of
gazing on the sea with its ever-changing
beauty, and the kind-hearted old farmer
would often drive the children in his gig
down to the shore, and leave them there
with their books and work for hours together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Mrs. Morris contrived an easy
folding couch for Daisy, which was carried
down without trouble, and on which she
was able to rest, and enjoy the view without
fatigue.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i056.jpg" alt="Girls at the seashore"></div>

<p>The soft, mild air, with the invigorating
sea-breezes, soon brought returning strength
to her and little Lizzie, and the quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
peaceful life in the old farmhouse was a
time of rest and enjoyment long remembered
by them both. The bright
mornings were generally spent on the shore;
and in the afternoon, while Daisy rested in
the pleasant bay-window of the parlour,
little Lizzie often went with Mrs. Morris
on some mission of love to one or other of
the fishermen’s or farm-labourers’ cottages
scattered over the valley.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as a great treat, the child
was allowed to go by herself, to carry a
basket of eggs or a pat of home-made
butter, with some tea and sugar, to an aged
man and his wife, formerly employed on
the farm, but who were now past work,
and lived in a lonely cottage half-way down
the cliff. The little girl was always welcome
to the good old couple, and many
a happy half-hour she spent with them,
sometimes reading to them as they sat in
the chimney-corner out of the large Bible,
which always lay open on the table;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
sometimes sitting on a little stool at their
feet, and listening to them as they talked
of the days long gone by, when children’s
feet had trodden their cottage-floor, and
another little girl had occupied the same
stool Lizzie was sitting on. Sometimes
they would go over the old story, and tell
her how, one by one, all those children had
been taken from them, in infancy or early
childhood, and had been laid side by side
to rest, in a quiet corner of the little
churchyard under the hill; but how they
knew and rejoiced to think that all were
safely gathered into the blessed home to
which day by day they were drawing
nearer themselves.</p>

<p>One day, when the wind was rising and
the sea very rough, the old man told Lizzie
to watch the fishing-boats coming into the
bay, and then said:</p>

<p>“You see those little storm-tossed boats,
my lassie, making for the harbour; they’ve
had a rough time of it, and I’ll venture to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
say, there isn’t a man in them who won’t
be glad to set his foot on shore. It’s a
rocky coast this, and many’s the brave ship
I’ve known in my time wrecked off the
rocks yonder, let alone the little cockleshells
of fishing-boats. Ah, my child, it’s
just a picture of our life. We’re all launched
on a stormy sea; and, though some have a
smoother passage than others, I believe
there are waves and storms for all. Happy
for those that have with them in the ship
the one Pilot that can bring them safely
through all storms, into the quiet haven.”</p>

<p>The child looked up earnestly into the
man’s face as he spoke, and then said:
“Daisy says she thinks the haven must be
all the more welcome when the boats have
had a rough passage.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and Daisy’s right too, my child;
the storms and danger make the rest and
peaceful shelter seem all the sweeter; and
heaven will seem all the more welcome
when the voyage has been full of storms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The old man murmured softly to himself,
“Then are they glad because they be
quiet; so He bringeth them unto their
desired haven.”</p>

<p>The wind now began suddenly to increase
in violence; and fearing to detain
the child any longer, the old man desired
her to hurry home at once, going with her
himself to the top of the zigzag path which
led up the cliff, and watching till he saw
her little form disappear through the gate
leading to the farm.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HAT night the storm raged with terrible
fury, and many were the anxious
hearts in the valley, many the eyes that
saw no sleep, but watched and prayed till
morning light, “for those in peril on the
sea.”</p>

<p>Daisy and her little companion lay awake
all night listening to the waves lashing up
against the shore, and to the hurricane
which swept round the farmhouse. At
times it seemed to them as if the house
itself swayed to and fro, and they clung
tremblingly to one another; but the old
dwelling was built high up on the rock,
and was protected by the hill behind, and
when the light of day broke over it, it
stood secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Farmer Morris was up before dawn, and
calling his men together, assembled them
for prayer in the old kitchen; and then
telling them to lose no time in following
him to the shore, he made his way down
to the bay as speedily as possible. A sad
sight greeted him there, a fine ship lying
on her beam-ends, about a hundred yards
from the shore, utterly dismasted, and
going to pieces as fast as possible. Some
groups of fishermen were busily engaged
in trying to rescue portions of the cargo,
which were being continually washed up
on the shore; while others with their wives
were intent on ministering to the half-drowned
crew, all of whom by aid of the
lifeboat had been rescued from a watery
grave.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris was not long in following
her husband to the shore. She was well
known in the fishermen’s huts, and was at
all times a welcome visitor, for all knew
that in trouble or trial of whatever kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
they had only to turn to the old farm under
the shadow of the hill, and be sure of ready
help and sympathy. As she stepped out
of one of the cottages, a poor woman, the
wife of one of the fishermen, came out of
another close by, and said:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="Crew in a lifeboat"></div>

<p>“Maybe you’ll be so good as to step
into our house next, mistress. There’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
poor man, one of the crew that was saved
last night, but I doubt he’s bound for a
better shore; he was longer coming to
than any of the others, and it seems, from
what some of them say, he’s been ill a long
time.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris went with her at once into
the cottage, and on opening the door of
the inner room stepped softly to the poor
man’s bedside, and sat down by him. He
was asleep; but one glance at his thin face
and emaciated hands told only too plainly
that the woman’s words were true, and
that he was, as she expressed it, soon bound
for a better shore.</p>

<p>After some time he awoke; and on
seeing Mrs. Morris, he asked her if she
would be so good as to read to him,
pointing to a little well-worn Bible which
lay on his pillow. Mrs. Morris turned to
the thirty-second Psalm; and when she had
finished reading it, and had spoken to him
of Jesus as the sure refuge and only hiding-place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> 
for poor sinners, he looked up at her
earnestly, and said:</p>

<p>“Blessed be God, I have found that
refuge, through His grace and goodness,
for never did any poor sinner have greater
need of such a refuge and such a hiding-place.”</p>

<p>He spoke with difficulty, and the effort
to say this seemed almost too much for
him, for he sank back exhausted. Mrs.
Morris did not press him to talk any more;
but with a few soothing words, and an
earnest prayer that Jesus would light for
him the dark valley, the shadows of which
were now gathering around him, she took
leave of the poor man, desiring the woman
in whose cottage he was to see that he
wanted for nothing, and promising to
return later in the day.</p>

<p>The other sufferers occupied much of
her time and care; and it was not until
late in the afternoon that she was able to
see the poor dying sailor again. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
found on reaching the cottage that he had
rallied a little since the morning, and was
able to talk with much less difficulty. As
she sat down by him he looked up with an
earnest expression, and said, “I want you
to tell me once again the glad news that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners. I have heard it again and again,
but I am never tired of hearing the same
sweet sound.</p>

<p>“The voice that first told me of my
need of a Saviour, that first bid me look
to Jesus, is silent now. It was a young
cabin-boy on board the ship I first sailed
in from England. We had a rough voyage,
and out in the Atlantic met with such a
storm as made my coward heart quail. I
remembered how, in days gone by, as a
little child my mother had taught me of
God, and told me I need not fear in the
dark because He would be near and take
care of me; but now this thought did
not quiet my heart. I felt that God was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
near, and that it was His voice speaking
in the storm; but I could not look up to
Him as a friend, and the thought of His
being near only made me tremble with
fear. I had lived so long in sin and
without God in the world, that surely He
would not listen to me now, or take care
of me in the storm. All my past life
seemed in a moment to stand out before
me, and the thought of what a dark picture
it was filled me well-nigh with despair.
As I heard the wind and the waves roaring,
and looked out into the thick darkness,
I felt there was not a glimmer of hope for
me. Just then this young cabin-boy, who
had often spoken to me of the Saviour, but
whom I and another man on board had
never lost an opportunity of jeering at,
came past me. He had been with a
message from the captain to the mate;
and as he passed me in the dark, I thought
I caught sound of the words, ‘I will fear
no evil, for Thou art with me.’ At any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
other time I should probably have laughed
at him; but I was in no mood for jesting
now; and something forced me to call out,
as he went by, ‘Aren’t you afeared,
Charlie?’ for I was trembling myself from
head to foot. The boy stopped and said,
‘No, master, I’m not afeared. When the
storm in the heart’s once been stilled, the
outside storms can’t alarm one; if one’s
heart is only in the harbour, there’s no
room for fear.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Amid the howling wintry sea</div>
<div class="verse">We are in port if we have Thee.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Ah, mistress, I would have given the
world at that moment to have felt as that
young lad did; though many a time when
he had spoken to me before of the sure
haven for storm-tossed souls, I had laughed
at him, and told him there would be time
enough to seek the harbour when the
storm came, that we didn’t want it in
smooth sailing. Ah, how well I recollect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the sad look which came over his face
when I spoke so, and how gravely he
would say, ‘Ah, Master Smith, you should
put into that port in bright weather, if you’d
know how to find it in the storm.’</p>

<p>“He had hardly passed by when a tremendous
wave broke over the ship, and
it was hard work for the men to stand at
the pumps.</p>

<p>“In the roar of the wind and sea I heard
the young boy’s voice: ‘Call upon God,
Master Smith, call upon God! He says,
“Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and
I will deliver thee.”’ And then and there
in the darkest night I have ever spent in
my life, and yet not quite the darkest, for
before it had ended a gleam of light had
shone across my heart, I did call on God,
as I clung for my life to the side of the
ship, and prayed Him to have mercy on
my poor benighted soul, as I had never
before prayed in my life. But the lad’s
voice I have never heard again; the wave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
that washed over the ship had borne away
with it the soul that was the most ready
of all on board to meet its God. Those
words, ‘Call upon God, Master Smith,
call upon God!’ must have been well-nigh
his last on earth. The storm that was my
call to the Saviour was his to go home;
and surely never was anyone so young more
ready for the summons. I never knew
a lad so fearless in danger, so ready to
witness for the Lord, so little afeared of
man. There wasn’t a man on board that
didn’t in his heart respect him, even if he
didn’t think with him. I found his jacket
the next morning; he had taken it off, to
be more ready to help the men at the
pumps, and there in the pocket was the
little Bible I had so often seen him reading.
I couldn’t help a tear or two when I
opened it, and saw how well worn and used
it was.</p>

<p>“Here’s the Bible, mistress; I have kept
it ever since; and, blessed be God, through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
reading that Book, I have found pardon
and peace, and a hope that, poor miserable
sinner as I am, I shall one day reach the
home that dear lad has most surely gone
to, through the love of the Saviour who
came into the world to save sinners such
as I. That Book has been my constant
companion ever since by night and by day;
and, thank God, it was made the means of
salvation to another man besides myself,
the very one who used to join with me in
jeering poor Charlie Green; he died in
peace through reading this blessed Book.
He too, like me, had lived in sin and in
forgetfulness of God, and when he fell ill
he was afraid of the thought of death.
I used to read to him; I had found peace
then myself, and I couldn’t do less than
try to put him in the way of finding it too.
I had seen the beacon light which saved
my poor soul from shipwreck, and guided
me into the haven of refuge, and wasn’t I
bound to do my utmost to point it out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
some other storm-tossed soul? He told
me much about his past life, how he had
left his poor dying wife and children, and
knew nothing of what had become of them;
and he made me promise, before he died,
that if ever I came back to England, I
would try to find out where they were, and
tell them how he repented of his past life,
and had come as a poor sinner to seek
forgiveness at the feet of Jesus. He used
often to say he knew that he was the chief
of sinners, but that in this blessed Book he
had found that there was hope, even for
the vilest that came and touched the hem
of the Saviour’s garment; and sure enough
he found peace in looking to ‘the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sin of the world.’</p>

<p>“He often spoke of his two children,
and said he prayed that God would teach
them to know a Saviour’s love; and that
although their earthly father had forsaken
them, the Lord Himself would take them
up. I should like to have done what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
I could to find out something about them
and their mother; but now I fear I shan’t
be able. I know I haven’t long to live,
and my voyage is almost over. I hardly
thought I should have lived through last
night. I had no strength to stir hand or
foot myself, and if they hadn’t lifted me
into the boat I must have been drowned,
for the ship was filling fast; but, oh, how
different I felt from what I did in the last
storm! Now I could say to myself a verse
I had many a time heard poor Charlie
sing when the wind was against us, and
the sea rough:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘One who has known in storms to sail</div>
<div class="indent2">I have on board;</div>
<div class="verse">Above the raging of the gale</div>
<div class="indent2">I hear my Lord.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, mistress, it’s one thing to have to face
the storm alone, but quite another to meet
it with Christ. I could now understand
what Charlie meant when he said, ‘The
inner storm was stilled, and so the outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
storms couldn’t alarm him.’ One had
come by and said unto my soul, all tossed
with sin and misery, ‘Peace, be still,’ and
now ‘there was a great calm.’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘I came to Jesus as I was,</div>
<div class="indent">Weary and worn and sad:</div>
<div class="verse">I found in Him a resting-place,</div>
<div class="indent">And He has made me glad.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Morris was deeply touched and
interested in the poor man’s story. As
she rose to go, she turned once more to
look at the little Bible which had been so
blessed to him and others, and on opening
it her eyes caught sight of the name,
“Morley,” written on the fly-leaf. On
examining it more closely she was still
more astonished at the inscription, which
was as follows:</p>

<p class="center">“Given to <span class="smcap">Charles Green</span>,<br>
on leaving the Ragged School,<br>
with the best wishes of his sincere friend and teacher,<br>
<span class="smcap">Susan Morley</span>.</p>

<p class="center">‘Oh satisfy us early with Thy mercy, that we may
rejoice and be glad all our days.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Charles Green was an orphan boy in
whom Susan Morley had taken great
interest. He had attended the ragged
school regularly for three years, and during
the last part of the time Susan had been
much encouraged about him, and had begun
to hope that the good seed had taken root
in his heart. Still, she had never felt quite
sure that the boy had really given his heart
to the Saviour, and often after he had left
the school, as years passed away without
her hearing of him, she had many anxious
thoughts about him. Her great hope had
been in the Bible which she had given him
on parting, and in the promise he had made
her that he would read a few verses in it
every day. No day had passed since he
sailed from England in which Susan
Morley did not pray for the sailor boy far
away on the sea, and ask that the Word of
God might find an entrance into his heart,
and make him “wise unto salvation through
faith which is in Christ Jesus.” And how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
abundantly her prayers had been answered,
beyond all that she had thought or expected,
we have already seen.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. On inquiring the
name and other particulars respecting the
poor man who had died in peace through
reading the Bible given by Susan to
Charlie Green, Mrs. Morris discovered on
her next visit to Robert Smith that it could
have been none other than the father of
Polly and Lizzie. She took Lizzie with
her several times to visit the dying sailor,
and he was much interested in seeing the
child of his former shipmate. Poor little
Lizzie would often read to him out of the
Bible her father had learned to love, and
was never tired of asking questions about
him, and would sometimes say:</p>

<p>“Polly and I used to pray to God to let
us see our father again, but now we must
pray to meet him in heaven.”</p>

<p>Robert Smith did not live many weeks.
He had no friends living, and seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
desire nothing further, now that he knew
that the children of his comrade were alive
and well cared for. Mrs. Morris visited
him constantly, and saw that he wanted for
nothing. Resting on Jesus, he passed
away in peace, with the words on his lips
of his favourite hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Hide me, O, my Saviour, hide,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the storm of life be past;</div>
<div class="verse">Safe into the haven guide,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, receive my soul at last.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus already had much blessed fruit
sprung from the patient labours and earnest
prayers of one young teacher in a little
ragged school; surely only an earnest of
further and fuller blessing reserved for the
day of harvest by Him who has promised
that His word shall not return unto Him
void, but shall accomplish that which He
pleases, and prosper in the thing whereto
He sends it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was with feelings of deep joy and
thankfulness that Susan Morley heard
of the events related in the last chapter.
Writing back to Daisy, who had sent her
the glad news, she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Daisy</span>,</p>

<p>“We were all glad to have your last
letter, and Lizzie’s, and to find that you are
both so much better. I need not say how
thankful we all were, and especially poor
Polly, at hearing the particulars of her
father’s happy death. Though she could
not help at first sorrowing that she will
never see him on earth, she feels it is
indeed far better to know that he is safe in
heaven, and to have the blessed hope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
meeting him there. How wonderful it was
that it should have been brought about
in that way, and through his reading
Charlie Green’s Bible—the Bible, Daisy,
you and I asked might be made the means
of guiding some one else’s feet, beside his
own, into the way of peace! How thankful
I am, too, that one of the dear ragged
boys, and especially Charlie, whom I have
thought of so constantly, and have often
felt so anxious about, should have been
made such a blessing, and enabled to witness
for Jesus in life, and to testify in death
that he feared no evil because He was
with him!</p>

<p>“I am sure you will be glad to hear that
Mrs. Grey, dear little Bessie’s stepmother,
is beginning to read in earnest the little
Bible Bessie loved so dearly, and we must
pray that she too may receive the kingdom
of God as a little child. She brought the
twins last week, and asked to be allowed
to send them to the school where Bessie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
learned the way to heaven; and the neighbours
say that she is wonderfully changed,
and so much more gentle than she used to
be. She comes regularly to the mothers’
meeting, and has been at church every
Sunday evening for the last two months.
She often says she is cut to the heart when
she thinks of poor little Bessie’s gentle
ways, and how hard she used to be to her.
But I tell her not to grieve too much, for
‘the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from
all sin;’ and little Bessie is where the
angels rejoice over one sinner that repenteth,
and where the broken and contrite
heart is not despised. I think God is
giving her this broken heart, and perhaps
little Bessie is now, with those other bright
spirits, rejoicing over her.</p>

<p>“The dear little school is prospering;
Jane Hardy is a great help, and, next to
Polly, the best monitress we have. They
often go to read to Mrs. Grey, and she
takes kindly to them for the love they bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to little Bessie. It is cheering to see how
many dear children are gathering in; and
everything, and especially the tokens for
good God has given us lately so strikingly,
seems to bid us ‘not to be weary in well-doing,
for in due season we shall reap, if
we faint not.’</p>

<p>“In <i>due</i> season, Daisy; that must mean
in God’s own time—sooner or later—here
or there; and we in the meantime must
pray and hope, and patiently wait, while we
work on, till God shall call us to His own
rest; and then, if not before the due time,
the day of harvest will come, when He
says, ‘they who sow and they who reap
shall rejoice together.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate sister,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Susan Morley</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dear, patient workers for Jesus in lowly
vineyards such as this, faint not, neither
be weary. Look up for the grace that is
sufficient for all difficulties and all discouragements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and look on by faith to the
day when you shall see what God asks
you now perhaps to take on trust, that
“your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”</p>

<p>In that day you shall find how the
long years of ploughing were not lost, but
were most surely preparing the way for
the precious seed; how every grain you
once scattered for Him, watered by your
prayers, and perhaps by your tears, has
been guarded and watched over by your
Lord, and turned into golden sheaves, to
be laid down by you in the day of harvest
at His feet, saying, “Not unto us, O Lord,
not unto us, but unto Thy name be the
glory.”</p>
